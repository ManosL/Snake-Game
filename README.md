# Snake-Game

Hello,

This is my first game on C++ which is the classic snake game.

Manual:
  ->You can change width and length open main.cpp and change
  the defined values WIDTH and LENGTH.
  
  ->To compile it write on the terminal the command 'make' 
  and if you want to delete the object files and the 
  executable file write the command 'make clean'.
  
  ->To execute it write the command './Snake_game'.
  
  ->Gameplay: first press the 'p' button to begin(WARNING:
  the key must not be on caps lock mode or in other language)
  'w':moves the snake up
  'a':moves the snake left
  's':moves the snake down
  'd':moves the snake right
  'q':quits the game
  
Note: In the file ready_functions.c the functions kbhit,getch and
  getchar_silent I took them ready because I don't know how to use
  the libraries that helped me with these functions.
  
UPDATE: Just tried to put some colors

  If you find any bugs contact me. Thanks for your time.
